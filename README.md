# Next Link

This Obsidian plugin allows for efficient navigation between note links in Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

For best performance bind the next and previous link commands to your preferred keyboard shortcuts. 

Recommended key bindings:
- Ctrl+H and Ctrl+L for previous and next link, respectively
- Use https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-vimrc-support to bind the previous and next link command to your preferred Vim normal mode chords e.g. Shift-Tab and Tab
- Bind "Follow link under cursor" to your preferred shortcut (e.g., Alt+Enter). Now you can navigate notes without leaving your keyboard!
